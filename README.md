# LiTeC #
In this group project, we wrote a compiler for LiTeC programming language. <br />
LiTeC (.ltc {lowercase L, T, C}) is a high-level imperative, general-purpose programming language. Our language is not focused on one primary goal; instead, we are trying to solve different problems. The name LiTeC is derived from: ‘Li’ referring to LISP and its list processing; ‘Te’ referring to TeX and its type-setting system; and, ‘C’ referring to the C language, the primary influence on LiTeC.<br />

## Installations required ##
We used Flex and Bison tools for lexical analyzer and parser generators<br />
On Linux:<br />
Flex: sudo apt-get install flex<br />
Bison: sudo apt-get install bison<br />

## Commands to run ##
bash runme.sh <br />
./parser example.ltc<br />
(example can be any executable file)
